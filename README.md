# Zenith Interface
> *An instrument of pure focus. Crafted from digital aerospace titanium and sapphire glass.*


## ✦ Overview

**Zenith Interface** is an ultra-premium, high-fidelity landing page experience designed to push the boundaries of modern web interactivity. Built with **Next.js 15**, **GSAP**, and **Framer Motion**, it embodies an "Upper Class" aesthetic inspired by high-end fashion editorials and architectural precision.

This project demonstrates advanced frontend engineering techniques, including physics-based interactions, WebGL-style distortion (simulated), and cinematic scroll storytelling.

## ✦ Key Features

### 1. High-Fidelity Interactions
*   **🧲 Magnetic Physics**: Buttons and interactive elements possess a magnetic field, physically pulling towards the cursor for a tactile feel.
*   **🔦 Spotlight Intelligence**: Feature cards track mouse movement, shedding dynamic light on borders to reveal content.
*   **🖱️ Custom Difference Cursor**: A custom blend-mode cursor that ensures visibility on any background, adding an avant-garde touch.

### 2. Cinematic Storytelling
*   **🎞️ Dynamic Film Grain**: A procedural noise texture that reacts to scroll velocity, intensifying during rapid movement to simulate analog film speed.
*   **📜 Editorial Typography**: Massive, tight-tracking headers paired with generous whitespace, mimicking luxury print media.
*   **🔓 Text Scramble Decryption**: Key headers "decrypt" themselves upon entry, emphasizing the high-tech, secure nature of the product.

### 3. Advanced Motion
*   **🌌 Parallax Image Masks**: Images move at different velocities within their containers, creating a "window into another world" depth effect.
*   **🌊 Infinite Kinetic Marquee**: A seamless, high-performance scrolling band that adds constant horizontal energy.
*   **⏱️ Cinematic Preloader**: A minimalist counter sequence that builds anticipation before the interface is revealed.
